# clj-nd4j

An implementation of [core.matrix](https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix) protocols with [nd4j](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/). Most importantly this is supposed to allow the usage of the jcublas backend of nd4j and the integration of [deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/) code in Clojure projects.
